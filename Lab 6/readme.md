# Executive Summary

#  Internet Architecture

##  Internet Protocol
IP Address - This is pretty much a computers mail box on the internet. This is what the internet uses to make sure it sends info to the correct person. It sends packets back and forth to establish this connection.

IPV4 Vs IPV6 - IPV4 is what connected the internet for 30 years but it has limited space so after so much expansion it began to run out of room. IPV6 is very simalr but insted of being based in 32 bit it was based in 128 bit which gives it so much more space (I do not want to go looking for the number). SO the main diffrence is the space of URLs it can hold.

ICANN- ICANN is The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers and their goal is to have a safe and stable internet by allocating space on the internet for webpages.

## TCP/IP

TCP/IP -The reponsiblity of TCP/IP is to define the data sent across the networks and is at the heart of the interent.

Client-Sever model - In this model TCP/IP is pretty much like the phone line and passes info across in this and the IP address is like the phone numbers.

Layers - Much like onions the internet has layers. The reason for this is because if something was writen on on stack any time you wanted to change or add something you would need to change the whole stack. With multiple stacks you can just stack on top of it and still keep the origonal

Aplication layer- Going through the article it looks like most HTTP applications run on the application layer.

## Internet Security

HTTP - is the webs applicattion layer and is used to transfer data across the internet. The info is sent in plain text however. This works in client sever because it is used because it communicates accross the web/ sever to the client

Protocals - The protocals used to protect info is HTTPS which encripts the data sent out so people can not read it. It also can use SSL which makes a website identify itself using a SSL cert. TLS is now the biggest security It is the secsess to SSL and uses the same method with checking certs.

## Securing Your Web Browser

Why?- You should secure your browser because there is always a risk of compromising your computer so keeping it proteced up front will help with this.

Risks - I saw plug ins as a risk as they can cause buffer overflows and have flaws that can be used to compromize data and or your computer.
