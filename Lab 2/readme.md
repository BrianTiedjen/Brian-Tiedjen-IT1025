# Hard Drives
Latency - Is how long it takes for the HDD to find and use a file 

Transfer Rate - Is the rate it writes the file to the HDD

SSD - An SSD is a chip and not a disk. This makes it so it can read, write, and find files much faster. This also makes it safe as there are less moving parts in the SSD
# Memory
RAM - Adding more RAM makes a computer run faster because this is the space it has to work with programs. Adding more RAM is giving it more "counter space" to work on the programs. ( This is how I explain RAM to older customers when I sell them computers)

32-Bit and 64-Bit - So in simple terms 32-Bit can use  4,294,967,296 values and can only acess and use 4 GB of ram while a 64 bit can use 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 values and can acess a theyoredical ammount of 16.8 million terabytes of ram.
