# Hard Drives
Latency - Is how long it takes for the HDD to find and use a file 

Transfer Rate - Is the rate it writes the file to the HDD

SSD - An SSD is a chip and not a disk. This makes it so it can read, write, and find files much faster. This also makes it safe as there are less moving parts in the SSD
# Hardware: ALU and the Control Unit

The control unit takes in the instruction and specifies what kind of operation it is. The ALU takes that info and inputs and gives out an output given the infomation it has.

# Hardware: CPU, Input & Output

In a self check out. First the input tell the device what items I have scanned. Then the CPU processes the things I have scanned and the memeory stores it. It then shows an output of the items I scanned, the price that item is, and the total price of everything.

#  Hardware: Logic Gates and Circuits

//A truth table identifies if something is true or faulse given the info that was inputed. A NAND gate is the exact oposite of a AND gate.//

# Hardware: IEEE - Ethically Aligned Design

# Memory
RAM - Adding more RAM makes a computer run faster because this is the space it has to work with programs. Adding more RAM is giving it more "counter space" to work on the programs. ( This is how I explain RAM to older customers when I sell them computers)

32-Bit and 64-Bit - So in simple terms 32-Bit can use  4,294,967,296 values and can only acess and use 4 GB of ram while a 64 bit can use 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 values and can acess a theyoredical ammount of 16.8 million terabytes of ram. 

# Data Representation: Numeric Conversions 

Decimal - Base 10 counting (what we use normally) using 0-9

Binary - Base 2 counting only using 0 and 1

Hexadecimal - Base 16 counting using 0 - F

# Data Representation: Hexadecimal Color Representation 
 The color #ff016b per the website https://www.colorhexa.com/ff016b states that "The hexadecimal color #ff016b has RGB values of R:255, G:1, B:107 and CMYK values of C:0, M:1, Y:0.58, K:0. Its decimal value is 16712043."
 
 The problem with the color is that it is a high constrast that is problematic for people with vision or color defficencys
