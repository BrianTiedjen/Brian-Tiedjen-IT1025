# Executive Summary

# Software

Application - Software that lets you do something such as a web browser to surf the web or spotify to listen to music or even visual studios to write code.

Utility - Software that lets you fix or modify your computer in some way. This is things like Antivirus or disk defrag.

Operating System Software - O/S software is the part of a computer that manages all the resources in a computer, Provides the user interface, and the platform to build and develop applications. Examples are Windows, Apple OS X, and Linux

### ERP software
Enterprise resource planning is the way for large companies can have one application to hold all of their systems together and work under one central database as opposed to have 100s of computers on seperate databases. An example would be if a company such as amazon had multiple severs or multiple databases then things could get mixed up, orders could be lost, and people would get angry. Under one database everything is clean and saves the company millions by not having to spend time fixing errors.

### Virtualization

Virtualization uses software and not hardware to create a virtual computer. The reason one would do this is because a server can only use a small part of the capasity of a computer while virtualization can use the potental that is locked out when using a server.

The thing that makes virtualization diffrent from cloud computing is that virtualization makes computers based on the physical structure of the device it is on while cloud computing uses shared computing resources by demeand from the internet.

# Virtualization

With Virtualization people could partition their severs to dedicate space for a specific virtual machine and also would allow people to run "legacy apps" or older applications on many diffrent O/S types and versions. This cut costs overall in bussniess.

Hypervisors is the part that breaks the hardware from the software. They are typically on top of the O/S but can be installed inside of it. The hypervisor also is what partitions the hardware for the software so the VM can work efficently with the hardware that is running.

# Python

Pseudo code is closer to real life talking and is easier to read and code for computers.

Interpreted languages is a when the code essecially has to be translated in a program but any O/S or anything can use this code if it has the way to read is, this is much slower. A compiled language is a code built for one O/S or one thing and is much faster because it is made to run on that O/S down to the byte.

#  Career Exploration 

## College Central 

I found several basic help desk internships in the area and also found some other overall technology internships that people starting off could definatly use to get their foot in the door or maybe even use as experince to get more into the IT field.

## Ocupation Finder

I found things like network admins and electrical engineer and what I saw on the website is many of them typically have a bachlers degree. I found this odd because almost all of the IT professionals I know and have met have an associates or lower in the jobs they have normally making six figures.

## Certifications

I looked at the cisco certs and from my understanding many of them can garentee you a job if you have one. It is very cool that they have something like this because if it was job experince deciding wherter you got a job or not many people would be out of luck. This makes it much easier to get into places. I plan to use a voucer for the CCNA if it is possible.

On the Tri-C site I found classes directly for the CCNA cirtification and I actually plan to take now that I know it is something that is offered through the school.
