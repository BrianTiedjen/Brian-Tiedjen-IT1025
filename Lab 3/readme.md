# Executive Summary
In this section, we will talk much on the software and networking side of IT work. We will cover overall software, virtualization, how to code in python, and how to get career ready in IT.

# Software

Application - Software that lets you do something such as a web browser to surf the web or Spotify to listen to music or even visual studios to write code.

Utility - Software that lets you fix or modify your computer in some way. There are things like Antivirus or disk defrag.

Operating System Software - O/S software is the part of a computer that manages all the resources in a computer, Provides the user interface, and the platform to build and develop applications. Examples are Windows, Apple OS X, and Linux

### ERP software
Enterprise resource planning is the way for large companies can have one application to hold all of their systems together and work under one central database as opposed to having 100s of computers on separate databases. An example would be if a company such as an amazon had multiple severs or multiple databases then things could get mixed up, orders could be lost, and people would get angry. Under one database everything is clean and saves the company millions by not having to spend time fixing errors.

### Virtualization

Virtualization uses software and not hardware to create a virtual computer. The reason one would do this is that a server can only use a small part of the capacity of a computer while virtualization can use the potential that is locked out when using a server.

The thing that makes virtualization different from cloud computing is that virtualization makes computers based on the physical structure of the device it is on while cloud computing uses shared computing resources by demand from the internet.

# Virtualization

With Virtualization, people could partition their servers to dedicate space for a specific virtual machine and also would allow people to run "legacy apps" or older applications on many different O/S types and versions. This cut costs overall in business.

Hypervisors are the part that breaks the hardware from the software. They are typically on top of the O/S but can be installed inside of it. The hypervisor also is what partitions the hardware for the software so the VM can work efficiently with the hardware that is running.

# Python

Pseudocode is closer to real-life talking and is easier to read and code for computers.

Interpreted languages are when the code essentially has to be translated in a program but any O/S or anything can use this code if it has the way to read is, this is much slower. A compiled language is a code built for one O/S or one thing and is much faster because it is made to run on that O/S down to the byte.

#  Career Exploration 

## College Central 

I found several basic help desk internships in the area and also found some other overall technology internships that people starting could definitely use to get their foot in the door or maybe even use as experience to get more into the IT field.

## Occupation Finder

I found things like network admins and electrical engineers and what I saw on the website is many of them typically have a bachelor's degree. I found this odd because almost all of the IT professionals I know and have met have an associate or lower in the jobs they have normally making six figures.

## Certifications

I looked at the cisco certs and from my understanding, many of them can guarantee you a job if you have one. It is very cool that they have something like this because if it was job experience deciding where you got a job or not many people would be out of luck. This makes it much easier to get into places. I plan to use a voucher for the CCNA if it is possible.

On the Tri-C site, I found classes directly for the CCNA certification and I plan to take now that I know it is something that is offered through the school.

## Co-ops / Internships

### Co-op eligibility

To be eligible you must be enrolled at Tri-C, 12 credit hours completed with at least 2 courses in your degree, and a GPA of 2.75 or higher. The benefits are that you can get a foot in the door of somewhere in your field, you can have job experience that many employers look for, get training better than any classroom can offer, and on top of all of that you get college credits for every 180 hours worked in a Co-op

## Industry Associations / Student Organizations

I chose the Cybersecurity club because it shows you not only how to start in cybersecurity but they give you a real look at what hackers will do and how to protect against it. Any IT field you are going into will be able to benefit from the club. I have personally gone to some of the meetings and I learned a good amount from just the meeting I went too. It is also very helpful to network with other people in your field so you can have contacts and friends for the future.

# Conclusion

In this, I learned a lot of software and VM ware information but I feel the biggest takeaway is the section of finding a career as this helped me find more info and helped me understand where to look for more help as I move forward in my career.
