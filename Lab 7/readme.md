# Executive summary

This lesson is a bit strange but I will be going over File compressions, Object oriented programing, and 
# File Compression

File compression is making a file smaller and more compact and can also be transfered faster.

Shrinking files - I noticed that with my SVG file that there was only a slight change because of the type of picture it is it has little room for compression. For a jpg it might shrink more because it has more of an ability to fold up or shirnk down on a computer

# Object Oreiented Programing

Method of the shark class - It can have a name, it can swim, and it can be awesome.

Constructor - This sets the default values for a class

Class vs object - Class is the blueprints for something and a object is the thing build from it 

#  Unified Modeling Language (UML)

OMG- This stands for Object Management Group which is the group that overlooks the definition and mantenice of of UML specifications

UML - Is a language is that is used for modeling a plan. It is a OOP method essicanlly. In the words of the website " UML has applications beyond software development, such as process flow in manufacturing." 

## Definitons
object - Sammy - This is the name of the shark

class - definition of a shark - It is the blueprints

abstraction - shark - Its the idea of the object

encapsulation - swim(self) - A action in a method for the shark

inheritance - a specific type of shark - It specifies the family of shark

# Conclusion

In this section I went through the why compressed files work and why we use them, How object oriented programing works aswell as the compentets of it, I also went of UML and its purpose.
