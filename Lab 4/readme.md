# Python IDLE

Shell takes code inputed and outputs them immideatly. It is basically where you code. It is good for testing lines of code or progrmas. The file editor is where you run the programs.
## Code Examples

Variable - This is like a box you put something into. The reason he gives it names like that is because its named after the monty python skit but he also does it to give it a memerable name  EX: Spam
Assignment statement - Gives a variable a value EX: Spam = 42
Function - Is the direction or instuctrion EX: Spam (the output will be 42 now)
Three data types - The three data types covered are intingers EX: 1 , floating- point numbers EX: - 1.25, and strings EX: 'a'

# Graphics
Raster vs. Vector Graphics - Raster is compsed of pixels, can not draw smooth lines and can only give a pixel approximation and Vector is composed of graph paths, can do smooth lines, and is more persise with pictures. Raster is better when the picture is going to stay "as is" and won't be zoomed in as this will cause pixialization. Vector can be zoomed in and not lose any quality so if you were going to be zooming in vector would be better.

Lossless vs. Lossy Compression - Lossless will keep it the exact same as it was before it was compressed. Lossy will remove some data in ways like drown the color palet to simple colors but will make files even smaller. It matters whether you want to keep the full data format of the picture and keep it how it is or if you want to sacrifice some quality for space.
 
File Formats - All of these allow you to store a picture but GIF is the only one that allows animation. Jpeg is good at screenshots of movies or games, PNG is good with line art and allows you to use transparency.
