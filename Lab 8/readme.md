#  Structured Query Language 

## RDBMS 
This is a form of databases that are related to one another. They are stored using in rows and colums. It is related to SQL because it is needed to use SQL in a website. SQL is used to created and edit databases.

I will do employees and orders. The primary key would be Employee ID because one ID is exclusivly given to each employee. The forign key would be the Order ID. The things they have in common are that the Emplyoee ID is in the data table of the orders.


# SQL Injections 
This is when user input was asked and the user for a input like a sign in. This can be used to send malisous code to the database.
To protect yourself you have to use SQL parameters. This makes it more controlled.
