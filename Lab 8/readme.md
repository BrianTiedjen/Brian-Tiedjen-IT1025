#  Data, Information and Knowledge 

## Relational Data

Data - This is raw infomation with no context (ex: 34 , red, 99)
Information - This is data with contect (ex: 34 students can swim, my least favorite color is yellow, 99 is my favorite number)
Knowledge - This is what someone does with information. (ex: someone bought me a outfit with the number 99 on it because it is my favorite number)

## My chart

My charts primary key would have First name, last name, Email, order number, and short details on the package.

The customers and orders would be related by having a email and order number attached to the order.

The foriegn key would be the order numbers, tracking number, and name attached to that account.

It is important to identify data types in data feilds because you have to know the context of what it is in order for it to be useful info
