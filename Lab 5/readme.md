# Lucid chat

Lucid chat is a strange app but I feel it can be very useful while coding. It is a space where I can put on paper what I am trying to do and it will be useful to explain my code to other people. Over all it was fun.
# Introduction to Networking

## Data Transmissions
Protocol - Set of rules that allow devices to communicate

Packet -Unit of data 

IP Address -Unique identifying number 

Packet Switching - Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination address 

DNS -Directory of IP address common names.  For example 54.239.26.214 might be the IP address of amazon.com 
 
 All of these are used in networking and communication of websites and the over all internet.
 
 ## Networking Hardware
 
 A switch is inteligent so it does not cause un-needed bandwith useage in the system making it more efficent. 
 
 A router is the most effecient and secure. It is used to connect networks together but you can not create a network with this. 
 
 ## Network Topologies
 
 A single point of faluer is if one point of a computer goes down then this kills the whole topology like a messy domino effect (I said domino and now I want pizza... I am hungry).Star, ring, and bus
 
 I think that the infastructure is best for a office setting but I think for average in home use I think the wireless mesh would be best. My reasoning is that is that infastructure has more versatility for a wired and wireless network which in a office setting is the most useful but many in home computer set ups use wireless features so having a strong connection for wireless matters most
