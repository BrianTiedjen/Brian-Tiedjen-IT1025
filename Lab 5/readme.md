# Lucid chat

Lucid chat is a strange app but I feel it can be very useful while coding. It is a space where I can put on paper what I am trying to do and it will be useful to explain my code to other people. Over all it was fun.
# Introduction to Networking

## Data Transmissions
Protocol - Set of rules that allow devices to communicate

Packet -Unit of data 

IP Address -Unique identifying number 

Packet Switching - Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination address 

DNS -Directory of IP address common names.  For example 54.239.26.214 might be the IP address of amazon.com 
 
 All of these are used in networking and communication of websites and the over all internet.
 
 ## Networking Hardware
 
 A switch is inteligent so it does not cause un-needed bandwith useage in the system making it more efficent. 
 
 A router is the most effecient and secure. It is used to connect networks together but you can not create a network with this. 
 
 ## Network Topologies
 
 A single point of faluer is if one point of a computer goes down then this kills the whole topology like a messy domino effect. Star, ring, and bus
 
 I think that the infastructure is best for a office setting but I think for average in home use I think the wireless mesh would be best. My reasoning is that is that infastructure has more versatility for a wired and wireless network which in a office setting is the most useful but many in home computer set ups use wireless features so having a strong connection for wireless matters most
 ## Network Disign
 
 I made a star system in my diagram. I made this becasue I think it is a relitlivly reliable and in-expenisve network to make.
 
 ## NSA / CSS
 
 The NSAs role in cyber security is that they monintor the internet for overall security threats and do assessments on these. So in short they are like the cops of the internet.
 
 # Cybersecurity and Encryption 

##Information Systems Security

### A

Confidentiality -  In the role I would have to verify accounts and possibly credit cards so it is important I do not share or copy any info given to me

Intergrity - Also in that role I would also be inside of client accounts so I would also have to not change anything in the accounts that is not requsted to be changed I do go into.

Avaliblity - Given the role I would have to change things in the accounts so the final part is the fact that Amazon would give me access to get inside of the accounts in a timely manner and after the proper varification.

### B

Three things I have to varify every day is my bank app, my works employee app, and my Xbox/Nintendo account. Two of them already are as I use an app called "authenticator" which requires a code when you try to go into the account. My gaming accounts I belive offer an option to send a text before I can buy anything

### C

ACL - Recources are tied to the user so if a user has a ton of data on the account it is really hard to remove it. It is good because it is simple and easy to understand though.

RBAC - This makes it much easier on the adminitrator, they can make a role and give the roles rights. And instead of giving roles or rights to person to person you give a person the role.
