# Executive summary

In this lesson I will be going over how networks work to both transfer data and how hackers use ciphers to break into those networks. We will be using Lucid chart to make a visual for this

# Lucid chat

Lucid chat is a strange app but I feel it can be very useful while coding. It is a space where I can put on paper what I am trying to do and it will be useful to explain my code to other people. Overall it was fun.
# Introduction to Networking

## Data Transmissions
Protocol - Set of rules that allow devices to communicate

Packet -Unit of data 

IP Address -Unique identifying number 

Packet Switching - Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on the destination address 

DNS -Directory of IP address common names.  For example, 54.239.26.214 might be the IP address of amazon.com 
 
 All of these are used in networking and communication of websites and the overall internet.
 
 ## Networking Hardware
 
 A switch is intelligent so it does not cause un-needed Bandwith usage in the system making it more efficient. 
 
 A router is the most efficient and secure. It is used to connect networks but you can not create a network with this. 
 
 ## Network Topologies
 
 A single point of failure is if one point of a computer goes down then this kills the whole topology like a messy domino effect. Star, ring, and bus
 
 I think that the infrastructure is best for an office setting but I think for average in-home use I think the wireless mesh would be best. I reason that infrastructure has more versatility for a wired and wireless network which is an office setting is the most useful but many in-home computer setups use wireless features so having a strong connection for wireless matters most
 ## Network Design
 
 I made a star system in my diagram. I made this because I think it is a relatively reliable and in-expensive network to make.
 
 ## NSA / CSS
 
 The NSA's role in cybersecurity is that they monitor the internet for overall security threats and do assessments on these. So, in short, they are like the cops of the internet.
 
 # Cybersecurity and Encryption 

## Information Systems Security

### A

Confidentiality -  In the role, I would have to verify accounts and possibly credit cards so it is important I do not share or copy any info given to me

Integrity - Also in that role I would also be inside of client accounts so I would also have to not change anything in the accounts that are not requested to be changed I do go into.

Availability - Given the role, I would have to change things in the accounts so the final part is the fact that Amazon would give me access to get inside of the accounts promptly and after the proper verification.

### B

Three things I have to verify every day is my bank app, my works employee app, and my Xbox/Nintendo account. Two of them already areas I use an app called "authenticator" which requires a code when you try to go into the account. My gaming accounts I believe offer an option to send a text before I can buy anything

### C

ACL - Resources are tied to the user so if a user has a ton of data on the account it is really hard to remove it. It is good because it is simple and easy to understand though.

RBAC - This makes it much easier for the administrator, they can make a role and give the rights of the roles. And instead of giving roles or rights to person to person you give a person the role.

### D

ciphertext- This works like a scrambler and hides the text. 
the public key is what is with the sender of the message
the private key is what someone needs to read the message.

## Cryptography
Caeser cipher -Unlike our alphabet, this form uses a method where it starts the alphabet at a different part but uses the same structure. EX: If you start the code at B the real letter B would be C.

Frequency - We talk in this way because language as a whole is a set construct. The letters would change in a different language but looking into it the meaning of the words shows up at the same frequency.

poluaphabetic - It is like a caeser cipher but uses more shifts in it for better encryption.
I notice that it seems almost random but it isn't. There is so much movement in it with the shifts that it causes a jumble even worse than before.

Brute-Force - Brute force is what it means to hit your head to the wall till something works. It tries hundreds of times with different shifts at different places until it finds the correct words. After spending some time looking at this I fail to see how they are supposed to be connected.

# Conclusion

We went over various forms of network managment and also showed how to set one up. We also build charts in lucid chart and got to play around with ciphers and how each kind works.
